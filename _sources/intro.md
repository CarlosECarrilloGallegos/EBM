# A Simple Energy Balance Model

This book goes through the process of creating a simple energy balance model of the Earth's atmosphere. 

It starts with a simple integrator to evolve the Earth's temperature over time given variable initial conditions. Then, we build an animated slider that can vary the Earth's temperature in real time.
